\section{Hands-on Table}
In the exhibition you will find a hands-on table with the invitation to start exploring and tinkering. If you want to continue later at home or in school, please check the web page of the Exploratorium / San Francisco to find further instructions and resources: \url{https://www.exploratorium.edu/snacks}. Science snacks are well tested activities with cheap and available materials on a broad variety of topics. Of course we recommend to search for ``music'' and ``math''.
