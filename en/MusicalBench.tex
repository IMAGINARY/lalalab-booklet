\section{Musical Bench}
The Musical Bench is an exhibit which makes music when people touch, kiss, or hold hands. It uses a micro-controller to detect changes in resistance, via the metal armrests, and plays high or low notes depending on how much current flows through you and a friend. 

A simple resistive voltage divider sensor circuit is used for input. The harder a person presses, or the more surface is in contact with the touch pads, or the moister a person's hands, the lower the touch resistance will be. Low resistances are mapped to high notes, so the harder a person presses, the higher the note. A light touch gets the low notes. With this information the chip arpeggiates the chromatic scale.
