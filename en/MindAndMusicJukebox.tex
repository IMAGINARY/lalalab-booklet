\section{Mind and Music Jukebox}
What are mathematicians and computer scientists favorite songs? What music inspires scientists? What music relaxes them? What music makes them dance?

The Mind and Music Jukebox presents the music of mathematics, or to be more precise, the music of mathematicians and other great minds! We asked mathematicians and researchers from the Women of Mathematics throughout Europe exhibition project and the recipients of the most prestigious awards in mathematics and computer science, namely the Abel Prize, the ACM A.M. Turing Award, the ACM Prize in Computing, the Fields Medal and the Nevanlinna Prize, to fill the jukebox with their beloved music pieces.

What music is your favorite? What music should be the background track of a mathematics class? What music makes you think?
